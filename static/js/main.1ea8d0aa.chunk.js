Let\u2019s start by talking about the two different parts of this definition.\n React is a JavaScript \u201clibrary\u201d. It is not exactly a \u201cframework\u201d. It is not a complete solution and you will often need to use more libraries with React to form any solution.React does not assume anything about the other parts in any solution.\nFrameworks serve a great purpose, especially for young teams and startups. When working with a framework, many smart design decisions are already made for you, which gives you a clear path to focus on writing good application-level logic. However, frameworks come with some disadvantages. For experienced developers working on large codebases, these disadvantages are sometimes a deal breaker.\nFrameworks are not flexible, although some claim to be. A framework usually wants you to code everything a certain way. If you try to deviate from that way, the framework usually ends up fighting you about it. Frameworks are also usually large and full of features. If you need to use only a small piece of them, you have to include the whole thing anyway. Admittedly, this point is changing today but it is still not ideal. ",secondParagraph:"React follows the Unix philosophy because it is a small library that focuses on just one thing and on doing that thing extremely well. That \u201cone thing\u201d is the second part of the React\u2019s definition: Building User Interfaces.\nA User Interface (UI) is anything we put in front of users to have them interact with a machine. UIs are everywhere, from the simple buttons on a microwave to the dashboard of a space shuttle. If the device we are trying to interface can understand JavaScript, we can use React to describe a UI for it. Since Web browsers understand JavaScript, we can use React to describe Web UIs.\nI like to use the word describe here because that is what we basically do with React. We just tell it what we want! React will then build the actual UI, on our behalf, in the Web browser. Without React or similar libraries, we would need to manually build UIs with native Web APIs and JavaScript and that is not as easy.\nWhen you hear the statement that \u201cReact is declarative\u201d this is exactly what it means. We describe UIs with React and tell it what we want (not how to do it). React will take care of the \u201chow\u201d and translate our declarative descriptions (which we write in the React language) to actual UIs in the browser. React shares this simple declarative power with HTML itself, but with React we get to be declarative for HTML UIs that represent dynamic data, not just static data.\nWhen React was released, there was a lot of buzz about its performance because it introduced the smart idea of a virtual DOM that can be used to reconcile the actual DOM (and we\u2019ll talk about that in the next section).",postedOn:"13/08/2020"},{id:3,title:"React JS for Beginners \u2014 The Basics",author:"Cem Eygi",category:"react",preview:"Learn more about the most popular JavaScript Library",image:"https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*y6C4nSvy2Woe0m7bWEn4BA.png",firstParagraph:"React got that name for a reason.

While I believe the API style was a key ingredient in jQuery\u2019s success, it wasn\u2019t invented by them \u2014 credits seem to go to Martin Fowler who coined the term back in 2005, roughly a year before jQuery was released. Fowler only gave the thing a name, though \u2014 Fluent Interfaces have been around for a much longer time.\nAside from major simplifications, jQuery offered to even out severe browser differences. It has always been the Fluent Interface that I have loved most about this extremely successful library. I have come to enjoy this particular API style so much that it became immediately apparent that I wanted this style for URI.js, as well. While tuning up the URI.js API, I constantly looked through the jQuery source to find the little tricks that would make my implementation as simple as possible. I found out that I was not alone in this endeavor. Lea Verou created chainvas \u2014 a tool to wrap regular getter/setter APIs into sweet fluent interfaces.

The actual problem is the asynchronousity of transitions. After writing a bunch of tests, I gave up on the task. It cannot be done with a reasonable amount of code and initialization time. My test results are what this article is all about.Before getting started with transitions, we have to talk about a little, frequently used, helper function. getComputedStyle() is a JavaScript method that returns a CSS property\u2019s value as the browser interprets it. This API goes back to \u201cDOM Level 2: getComputedStyle()\u201d and \u201cCSS Level 2: Computed Values\u201d \u2014 which basically specify that a computed style is an absolute value.",secondParagraph:"This is fine for properties such as font-size, which take only one argument and are reliably converted to pixel values.

Then there are properties with different but equivalent values to consider, such as font-weight\u2019s bold and 700.
